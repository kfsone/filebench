# Filesystem 'open()' benchmark

Benchmark of the filesystems performing opening files.

I was going to use 'open()' to eliminate the stdio overhead, but it's actually comparatively tiny
for the case of opening a file, and it made the code slightly more portable (lookin' at you win32).

# Building

cmake -DCMAKE\_BUILD\_TYPE=Release
cmake --build . --target SimpleBench

and then run the SimpleBench executable.

This will create ~1000 one-line text files in the current directory and then repeatedly open them,
capturing the timing, and then deleting them.
